This Health Insurance Portal is a web based project which is developed for tracking the details of the insurance policy, customer details and company details. 
This series of web pages is an online insurance analysis and information management system that provides easy access of information regarding the people and resources of insurance. 
User can view their own personal details when login into the Policy Holder module. This project is useful for any kind of insurance company to manage the insurance details, to sanction the insurance for customer, process the insurance policy details and all kind of insurance process through online.

# Scope :

My proposed project aims is to build and manage a database that can be very beneficial for a health insurance company. The health insurance company needs to keep track of all the details of its target companies, agents, policyholders, their premium payments and the various products they offer. In the project, we intend to use the concepts involved in handling the data acquired from insurance companies, agents, and employees using MySQL and PHP. The database will include multiple tables which will be managed efficiently. 
Some functions will run which would classify the policies based on their status that whether they are active, lapsed, etc. According to those classifications, different tables are created in database and according to functions, records are grouped in respective tables.
# SYSTEM SPECIFICATIONS : 

An attractive and methodical Insurance Policy Management System requires the amalgamation and utilization of modern technologies like the PHP, CSS and MySQL.
•	PHP - It is a server-side scripting language designed for web development but also used as a general-purpose programming language. PHP is an acronym for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor".
•	CSS - This is used for styling purpose. HTML coding is just a structure and CSS is applied to dictate the look and feel. Font size, font color, font style styling of images, page layout, and more are determined by CSS.
•	MySQL - It provides us a way to integrate and manage the database for the policy system by using the various commands to handle the queries.
•	XAMPP – This is a software used to connect php files and the database on a local server.
